# üßµ Threads Automation API ‚Äì FastAPI + Render

This project allows you to post to [Meta Threads](https://www.threads.net) programmatically via the **Threads API**,
using a secure backend powered by **FastAPI** and deployed on **Render**.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Full OAuth2 flow (via Meta Threads)
- Post new Threads (with or without image)
- Publish Threads after creation
- Combined route to post and publish in one go
- Designed to work perfectly with **Postman**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Deployment

### 1. üß∞ Environment Variables (`.env`)

Create a `.env` file locally or configure these in your Render dashboard:

```env
APP_ID=your_meta_app_id
APP_SECRET=your_meta_app_secret
REDIRECT_URI=https://your-app-name.onrender.com/auth/callback
```

### 2. üöÄ Deploying to Render

Render handles HTTPS out of the box, making it perfect for Threads API integration.

Create a file called render.yaml:

```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: threads-automate
    env: python
    buildCommand: "pip install -r requirements.txt"
    startCommand: "uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 10000"
    envVars:
      - key: APP_ID
        sync: false
      - key: APP_SECRET
        sync: false
      - key: REDIRECT_URI
        sync: false
```

Then push to your connected GitHub repo and let Render auto-deploy it with HTTPS support. Make sure this project is
pushed to a GitHub repository.


### 3. Setting up meta developer account

1. Go to the [Meta App Dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps).

The name of my project in render was called threads-automate. This is why the redirect callback URL and other stuff has
that specific URL.

### 4. üì¶ Install dependencies (if running locally) --THIS WONT WORK FOR THREADS LOCALLY SINCE IT NEEDS HTTPS

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üåê API Endpoints (Postman-friendly)

Use in browser only

Initiates the OAuth login flow:

```python
https: // your - app - name.onrender.com / login
```

## üîÑ GET /auth/callback

```python
{
    "access_token": "EAABsbCS1iHg...",
    ...
}
```

## üîÅ POST /post-and-publish-thread

```python
{
    "access_token": "your_access_token_here",
    "text": "This one goes straight to Threads üöÄ",
    "image_url": "https://your-image-url.com/image.jpg" // optional
}
```
